    <h3>When I woke up, there was a new dog in out house named "Hazel," and after eating a breakfast of chia seed pudding around 10:30 and making some orange juice from the oranges we had, I basically did nothing. I just played with the dogs, and then felt pretty tired so I took a nap for a while, and woke up around 3. After this, I was just lazying around the house, and didn't really do much, until my sister had to leave for gymnastics with my mom, where I went to walk the dogs. After I came back, both my parents were home, and we actually bought the PC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You couldn't imagine how I felt while clicking the place order button. I am ecstatic!!! I am so happy to announce that I will be getting a better computer. After this, the day calmed down, and I just ate dinner of korean beef before going to bed. This was one of my most laziest days, but probably my favorite so far!</h3>

    <h3>I woke up today to my sister's alarm, and when I came downstairs, there was another dog in the house from her petsitting business. I did the laundry and then ate breakfast, but it was more like lunch, because I ate it at around 11:30. Then I decided that I would do some things on this website, which I did, and figured out some logistics of what I can and can't do on github pages. Then, I tried to play some games, but when I tried to play one of them, it was super glitchy and unplayable because it was 3D. It was around here where my mom walked in and told me that she talked to my dad yesterday about the PC, and she told me that he said yes to me getting a PC, and she just needed to find out when to get it and do some budgeting. I'm so happy to finally be able to get a better computer, because my current one is so old. Later, I was pretty bored so I made some fresh squeezed orange juice, and decided to use the ice tray to make popsicles! When I ate them after a dinner of dosa and potatoes, they were amazing! Then, the other dog left, and I went with my mom for a walk with my dog to end the day.</h3>

    <h3>I'm finally back from my vacation, and writing again! It was an amazing vacation, where we were by the beach basically all the time, doing water activities, such as snorkeling and stand up paddleboarding. Anyways, when I woke up today, I was awoken by my mother, who opened the blinds and by doing so, blinded me, therefore waking me up. After I woke up, I remembered that my computer is very old, and can't run most things smoothly. (It was made in late 2013!) For reference, I was born in 2012. I got super excited when my mom told me that since I usually keep my laptop on the desktop anyways, I might be able to get a desktop PC! I was super stoked when I heard this and began researching to find a good one for my needs. When I began the search, the first result was a $127,000 SuperServer, and then the price dropped to a $5,000 PC, to a $2,000 PC, to a $1,500 PC, and finally, to a $950 PC that I really like. My mom wanted to get me a macbook pro, but this is cheaper and in my eyes, better, so I really hope my parents say yes and allow me to get it, because I'm getting kind of tired of hearing my current laptop use its fans all night, and have the battery inflate so that it can't close properly. Hopefully soon I will have a new computer! After this, my mom told me to make a login, sign up, and continue as guest, prompt for my website, with a greeting, but I really didn't want to. However, I did it anyway, after she forced me to, and I ended up doing it and coming up with a sleek new design for this website. After I finished, I played some Jump King, but not the steam store version, I played the github version on code-bullet.github.io/jump-king, and I actually ended up beating it! Then I played blackjack with my sister and went to write this and sleep.</h3>
