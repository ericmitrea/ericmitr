        <h3>I woke up to the sound of my dad and my sister talking while looking at the ants in the hallway. Someone had left some leftover Chipotle there overnight, and all the ants ended up swarming it. Me and my dad decided that we have had enough of these ants always crawling everywhere, so we decided to spend most of the day trying to get rid of them. We discovered that the type of ants are called Argentine ants, and they are an invasive species. They have multiple supercolonies, which are colonies that are connected to each other, with one of them going from Mexico to Canada! We started researching solutions, and came up with 2 things we would do. We would set traps with borax in them, to infect the ants, to which they will hopefully go back to the colony and infect the rest of the colony. The other thing we would do, is spray an insecticide perimeter around our house and at the tiny holes you barely notice in your garage, to keep the ants out. However, no matter what we do, I feel like it is never enough. For now, it seems to be working, and there are no ants around our house anymore, and the borax traps seem to attract ants, so hopefully they work. In the afternoon, my parents went to the mall, and me and my dad just relaxed for a bit, and watched some TV and soon enough, my mom and sister came back. When they came back, we ate dinner of fish stew, and went up to watch the new season of the show, "Panchayat." We did this until it was time to sleep, and I liked today. Hopefully the ants are gone soon!</h3>

        <h3>I woke up today around 9 so I could catch the Fifa Club World Cup match, between what I think are the 2 best teams in the competition, PSG and Bayern. In the end, PSG somehow won 2-0, even with 2 red cards, which at the end put them down to 9 players, against Bayern's 11. When that game finished, I ate breakfast of scrambled eggs, which I thouroughly enjoyed, and avocado toast, which I liked just as much. After breakfast, I mainly wasted more time until 1, when I knew the 2nd match of the day was, between Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid, which was mainly dominated in the start by Real Madrid, starting out strong in the first half, with a 2-0 lead, but Dortmund were able to get some back, and the game finished at a 3-2 score, with Real Madrid advancing to the semifinals to face PSG. I personally want PSG to win, and think they could easily beat Real Madrid. Soon after the game, me and my dad were at home, seeing as my sister and mom were at a pool party, we decided to watch an old movie, called "Crime Busters," starring Terrence Hill and Bud Spencer. I actually kind of liked it, and before I knew it, my mom was home, and it was 4 o'clock, or time to go to a family friend's house. While we were there, I mainly played with my dog, Rufus, and played some soccer with the kids there. We came home 2 hours later, and then me and my dad ended up fixing my bike, and replacing the axle finally. There is still stuff to be done, but for now we are done. Later, I ate dinner which was some delicious chipotle. To end the day, we watched the new season of Panchayat.</h3>

        <h3>The morning started off when I looked at the time, and realized that the Fifa Club World Cup match would start in 2 hours, or at 12pm, and I wanted to watch it. It was a quarter final match, between Fluminense FC and Al-Hilal. I quickly ate a breakfast of overnight oats. After about 15 minutes, I went with my dad to get a haircut, and it was about 11, so I wanted to get the haircut done quickly so I could come home to watch the match. When they called my name, I explained what kind of haircut I wanted, and the lady quickly got started, and soon enough, my haircut is done, and I really like it üòÑ! As we were driving home, I checked the time. 11:51 PM. I would have plenty of time to shower and get the match ready on the TV. For the next 2 hours, I watched the game, and it was a very close game, with Fluminense FC barely pulling ahead by a goal to send them through to the semi-final. During the game, I ate a bunch of applesauce, salad, and these mini protien rice crispy treat. After the match ended, everyone in the house pretty much went to sleep, and didn't do much, including me! I just kind of hung out in my room, until around 5, my mom called me down to help make dinner. We had some people over for the 4th of Julyüéâ. I helped my mom cut tomatoes, and get cucumbers, and soon, the people came. At around 6, I watched a different match, between Palmeiras FC and Chelsea. This was mainly the end of my night, and we watched some fireworksüéÜ and I went to bed.</h3>

        <h3>I woke up today around 10 and instantly was hit with a deep hunger. I rushed downstairs to get some cheerios and began eating them. As I ate, I checked my phone, and found out that a player on my favorite soccer team, Liverpool FC, diedüò¢ in a car accident in Spain. RIP Diogo Jotaüïä. After I finished eating, I saw a text from my friend about meeting at the high school nearby to play soccer, as he had gotten one of the balls that curve a lot more than normal. We made plans to meet around 3, but that was still 4 hours away. I was just minding my own buisness downstairs when my sister came and asked me to accompany her to one of her client's house, because she does petsitting. I was excited to see this client's cats, so I began prepping our bikes to ride to her house. When I checked my bike, I found that both the tires were flatüôÅ. I took one of the many bikes that we had in our house instead, and planned to repair my bike later. We got to the client's house about 10 minutes later, and my sister did all the things she needed to do, such as feed the 2 cats and clean out the litter box, while I stayed with the cats. They were so cute and small! Soon, she finished and we started riding back. Once we got home, I instantly got started on trying to fix my bike, so I replaced the inner tubes for both of the wheels. Next, I tried to put the wheel back, but found out that not all the gears worked when I did so, causing me to take it off again. I repeated this process, but each time I noticed that this specific nut wasn't tightening how it is supposed to. I went to ask my dad for some help. He told me that we needed a new nut, and we went to the nearby hardware store to find a replacement. Once we picked out our nut, we met with the store cashier, who ended up being one of our old neighbors before we moved to the house I live in now. By this time, it was around 2:50, and My dad was going to drop me off at the high school so I could play soccer with my friend. We played soccer for about 2 hours, and I had a lot of fun. The new ball he got curved so much that it felt unnatural, and we hit some crazy shots with it. It was amazing! When I got home, I decided to resume work on my bike. I finally tried the new nut that we had bought, and it didn't fit! I was getting kind of frustrated by this point, as it had been a couple of hours since I had started working on the bike. Then, my dad and I went back to the store for another nut, but when we came back and tried it, that one didn't fit either! We tried some other solutions using the newest nut that didn't fit, but just ended up making the axle of the wheel break, forcing us to have to buy a replacement online. We searched for it, but didn't find it until we got hungry, because it was around 6, and I hadn't eaten anything for lunch. I had some leftover korean beef, and a honey butter sandwich, as well as some bread with an onion and chive spread, seeing as we didn't really have much in the fridge for dinner. Soon after dinner, I took a shower and decided to go to bed around 9.</h3>

        <h3>I slept in a lot today, and when I woke up around 9, I saw a list of chores my sister and I had to do from a message my dad had sent.üò¢ The list outlined that my sister and I should put the washed clothes to dry outside and vacuum the house. I got started on putting the clothes out to dry pretty quickly, and when I was done, I came inside to find my mom and sister taking the dog to the vet.
        He was limping a bit latelyü§ï, so I was happy they were going. While they were gone, I just watched something on my computer as I ate breakfast. When they came back, I played a game     with my sister, in which you have to make eye contact at random intervals with the opposing person, while you have water in your mouth, and try not to laugh. We were both really        bad at this game, and the floors ended up getting pretty wet.
        After we played this game for a bit, I decided to eat lunch around 12:30, and I ate some salad. About 30 minutes after I started eating, I heard my dad's car come into the garage. <br>He came out of the car and talked to us for a bit, and got a bit mad at my sister, because she hadn't done her vacuuming. While she did that, I talked to him when he told me that after she was done vacuuming, I would have to mop the house. I got started a bit later, after my sister had finished vacuuming updstairs, while listening to an audiobook.
        It was by the author Rick Riordan, and it was really interesting. While listening to the audiobook, I breezed through mopping the floors, and soon finished. After I finished, I         decided to update this website, around 3. I added a bunch of stuff, such as the new update banner, and edits to the "archives" page. At the end of the day, after eating a dinner of Korean beef around 8, I wrote this entry before going to sleep. Overall, today was a pretty chillüßä day.</h3>

        <h3>I woke up and was feeling like I wanted to do something with this site, so I spent time updating this website so it looks like what it is right nowüë®‚Äçüíª. Later, I played some           Sekiro. I'm getting close to the end game!üôÉ I'm happy with today.</h3>

        <h3>Today I just went on my phoneüì± for the majority of the day, and also I took a napüò¥. I was very tired today, and didn't feel like doing anything. The day was pretty uneventful.     </h3>

        <br>
        <h3>It was my sister's birthday partyü•≥, and all her friends were at our house. I mostly stayed in my room, but also went to play some Sekiro on the xbox. Once all my sister's           friends left, I played some soccer outside‚öΩÔ∏è.
        After this, my mom made me clean up after the mess my sister and her friends made, along with my sister. This was completely unfair, seeing as I hadn't contributed to the mess at       allüò¢üòû, but she made me do it anyway. 
        Later in the day, I went to the poolüèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and had some fun there. Overall, it was a pretty good day.</h3>
