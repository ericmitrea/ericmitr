    <h3>Today was a very lazy day, and when I woke up around 10, I was still pretty tired, even though I had slept about 11 hours. My solution to this problem? Stay in bed till 11! When I came downstairs I was starving, and luckily, so were my mom and sister. However, they both had something small, like avocado toast, and I was left with the question; what should I eat for brunch? The answer to that question came from my mom, when she offered to make me an omelette. I was very happy, and accepted her offer, and we started making the omelete together. My job was to cut onions, while she cut the mushrooms, and got the pan ready for cooking. Once I finished cutting the onion, we both put all the vegetables in the pan, and added 3 eggs, while we waited for it to cook. I asked her if she was going to eat anything, and she said, "No, I already ate." Once the eggs were finished, I put them all on my plate. They looked like a mountain on my plate, but I was starving. Soon enough, all the eggs were gone, and I was super full. For the next few hours, nothing really eventful happened, I was just lazing around, and watching something, or eating a snack.<br> 
      Around 4, I felt like I wanted to do something, but didn't know what. I asked my mom, and she told me to finish fixing my bike. This was a grueling task that I really didn't want to get into, but nevertheless, I tried to fix it. She came outside with me, but after about 3 minutes, we both decided to go back inside, as it was hot, and we both didn't want to be there. After this, I decided to read an ebook while trying to take a nap, but got woken up when my mom wanted me to taste test some pasta sauce that my sister made, because she didn't want to get up from the couch, like myself. I begrudgingly got up from the couch, and ended up eating dinner of ravioli soon after. Since my sister made the ravioli, the task fell on me to clean the dishes and put everything on the table away, but as I was almost done, my mom took over the job so I could go take the dog for a walk. When I came back, I was pretty tired, so I wanted to just go to bed early, but I had to make a plan about the upcoming school year with my mom. After this, I went to bed. Tomorrow I've decided that I'm not going to be as lazy, and hopefully will do something more.</h3>
