    <h3>I slept in a lot today, and when I woke up I saw a list of chores my sister and I had to do from a message my dad had sent.😢 The list outlined that my sister and I should put       the washed clothes to dry outside and vacuum the house. I got started on putting the clothes out to dry pretty quickly, and when I was done, I came inside to find my mom and sister     taking the dog to the vet.
    He was limping a bit lately🤕, so I was happy they were going. While they were gone, I just watched something on my computer as I ate breakfast. When they came back, I played a game     with my sister, in which you have to make eye contact at random intervals with the opposing person, while you have water in your mouth, and try not to laugh. We were both really        bad at this game, and the floors ended up getting pretty wet.
    After we played this game for a bit, I decided to eat lunch, and I ate some salad. About 30 minutes after I started eating, I heard my dad's car come into the garage. He came out       of the car and talked to us for a bit, and got a bit mad at my sister, because she hadn't done her vacuuming. While she did that, I talked to him when he told me that after she was     done vacuuming, I would have to mop the house. I got started a bit later, after my sister had finished vacuuming updstairs, while listening to an audiobook.
    It was by the author Rick Riordan, and it was really interesting. While listening to the audiobook, I breezed through mopping the floors, and soon finished. After I finished, I         decided to update this website. I added a bunch of stuff, such as the new update banner, and edits to the "archives" page. At the end of the day, after eating a dinner of Korean        beef, I wrote this entry before going to sleep. Overall, today was a pretty chill🧊 day.</h3>

    <h3>I woke up and was feeling like I wanted to do something with this site, so I spent time updating this website so it looks like what it is right now👨‍💻. Later, I played some           Sekiro. I'm getting close to the end game!🙃 I'm happy with today.</h3>

    <h3>Today I just went on my phone📱 for the majority of the day, and also I took a nap😴. I was very tired today, and didn't feel like doing anything. The day was pretty uneventful.     </h3>

    <br>
    <h3>It was my sister's birthday party🥳, and all her friends were at our house. I mostly stayed in my room, but also went to play some Sekiro on the xbox. Once all my sister's           friends left, I played some soccer outside⚽️.
    After this, my mom made me clean up after the mess my sister and her friends made, along with my sister. This was completely unfair, seeing as I hadn't contributed to the mess at       all😢😞, but she made me do it anyway. 
    Later in the day, I went to the pool🏊‍♂️ and had some fun there. Overall, it was a pretty good day.</h3>
