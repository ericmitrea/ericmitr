    <h2 style="color: white;">Week of June 29 - July 6</h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Sunday, June 29: </h2>
    <br>
    <h3>It was my sister's birthday party🥳, and all her friends were at our house. I mostly stayed in my room, but also went to play some Sekiro on the xbox. Once all my sister's friends left, I played some soccer outside⚽️. <br>
    After this, my mom made me clean up after the mess my sister and her friends made, along with my sister. This was completely unfair, seeing as I hadn't contributed to the mess at all😢😞, but she made me do it anyway. <br>
    Later in the day, I went to the pool🏊‍♂️ and had some fun there. Overall, it was a pretty good day.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Monday, June 30: </h2><br> 
    <h3>Today I just went on my phone📱 for the majority of the day, and also I took a nap😴. I was very tired today, and didn't feel like doing anything. The day was pretty uneventful. </h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Tuesday, July 1:</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>I woke up and was feeling like I wanted to do something with this site, so I spent time updating this website so it looks like what it is right now👨‍💻. Later, I played some Sekiro. I'm getting close to the end game!🙃 I'm happy with today.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Wednesday, July 2:</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>I slept in a lot today, and when I woke up I saw a list of chores my sister and I had to do.😢 I moved the washed clothes outside to the drying rack, and went back inside, where I saw my mom and sister taking the dog to the vet. <br>
    He was limping a bit lately🤕, so I was happy they were going. Later, I mopped the floors, and made updates to this site. Today was a pretty chill🧊 day.</h3>
