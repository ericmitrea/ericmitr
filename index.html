    <h3>I woke up today around 10 and instantly was hit with a deep hunger. I rushed downstairs to get some cheerios and began eating them. As I ate, I checked my phone, and found out that a player on my favorite soccer team, Liverpool FC, died😢 in a car accident in Spain. RIP Diogo Jota🕊. After I finished eating, I saw a text from my friend about meeting at the high school nearby to play soccer, as he had gotten one of the balls that curve a lot more than normal. We made plans to meet around 3, but that was still 4 hours away. I was just minding my own buisness downstairs when my sister came and asked me to accompany her to one of her client's house, because she does petsitting. I was excited to see this client's cats, so I began prepping our bikes to ride to her house. When I checked my bike, I found that both the tires were flat🙁. I took one of the many bikes that we had in our house instead, and planned to repair my bike later. We got to the client's house about 10 minutes later, and my sister did all the things she needed to do, such as feed the 2 cats and clean out the litter box, while I stayed with the cats. They were so cute and small! Soon, she finished and we started riding back. Once we got home, I instantly got started on trying to fix my bike, so I replaced the inner tubes for both of the wheels. Next, I tried to put the wheel back, but found out that not all the gears worked when I did so, causing me to take it off again. I repeated this process, but each time I noticed that this specific nut wasn't tightening how it is supposed to. I went to ask my dad for some help. He told me that we needed a new nut, and we went to the nearby hardware store to find a replacement. Once we picked out our nut, we met with the store cashier, who ended up being one of our old neighbors before we moved to the house I live in now. By this time, it was around 2:50, and My dad was going to drop me off at the high school so I could play soccer with my friend. We played soccer for about 2 hours, and I had a lot of fun. The new ball he got curved so much that it felt unnatural, and we hit some crazy shots with it. It was amazing! When I got home, I decided to resume work on my bike. I finally tried the new nut that we had bought, and it didn't fit! I was getting kind of frustrated by this point, as it had been a couple of hours since I had started working on the bike. Then, my dad and I went back to the store for another nut, but when we came back and tried it, that one didn't fit either! We tried some other solutions using the newest nut that didn't fit, but just ended up making the axle of the wheel break, forcing us to have to buy a replacement online. We searched for it, but didn't find it until we got hungry, because it was around 6, and I hadn't eaten anything for lunch. I had some leftover korean beef, and a honey butter sandwich, as well as some bread with an onion and chive spread, seeing as we didn't really have much in the fridge for dinner. Soon after dinner, I took a shower and decided to go to bed around 9.</h3>

    <br>
    <h3>I slept in a lot today, and when I woke up around 9, I saw a list of chores my sister and I had to do from a message my dad had sent.😢 The list outlined that my sister and I should put the washed clothes to dry outside and vacuum the house. I got started on putting the clothes out to dry pretty quickly, and when I was done, I came inside to find my mom and sister taking the dog to the vet.
    He was limping a bit lately🤕, so I was happy they were going. While they were gone, I just watched something on my computer as I ate breakfast. When they came back, I played a game     with my sister, in which you have to make eye contact at random intervals with the opposing person, while you have water in your mouth, and try not to laugh. We were both really        bad at this game, and the floors ended up getting pretty wet.
    After we played this game for a bit, I decided to eat lunch around 12:30, and I ate some salad. About 30 minutes after I started eating, I heard my dad's car come into the garage. <br>He came out of the car and talked to us for a bit, and got a bit mad at my sister, because she hadn't done her vacuuming. While she did that, I talked to him when he told me that after she was done vacuuming, I would have to mop the house. I got started a bit later, after my sister had finished vacuuming updstairs, while listening to an audiobook.
    It was by the author Rick Riordan, and it was really interesting. While listening to the audiobook, I breezed through mopping the floors, and soon finished. After I finished, I         decided to update this website, around 3. I added a bunch of stuff, such as the new update banner, and edits to the "archives" page. At the end of the day, after eating a dinner of Korean beef around 8, I wrote this entry before going to sleep. Overall, today was a pretty chill🧊 day.</h3>

    <h3>I woke up and was feeling like I wanted to do something with this site, so I spent time updating this website so it looks like what it is right now👨‍💻. Later, I played some           Sekiro. I'm getting close to the end game!🙃 I'm happy with today.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Monday, June 30: </h2>
    <br> 
    <h3>Today I just went on my phone📱 for the majority of the day, and also I took a nap😴. I was very tired today, and didn't feel like doing anything. The day was pretty uneventful.     </h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Sunday, June 29: </h2>
    <br>
    <h3>It was my sister's birthday party🥳, and all her friends were at our house. I mostly stayed in my room, but also went to play some Sekiro on the xbox. Once all my sister's           friends left, I played some soccer outside⚽️.
    After this, my mom made me clean up after the mess my sister and her friends made, along with my sister. This was completely unfair, seeing as I hadn't contributed to the mess at       all😢😞, but she made me do it anyway. 
    Later in the day, I went to the pool🏊‍♂️ and had some fun there. Overall, it was a pretty good day.</h3>
