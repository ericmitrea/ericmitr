    <h3>Have you ever had an experience, where you were awake, but could go back to sleep, and you had to choose whether you would wake up or not? Well I had one today, where I woke up for a second to hear my mom saying, "don't worry Rufus, Eric will take you for a walk." Rufus is my dog by the way. I did not want to deal with walking the dog at the moment, so I just went back to sleep! Once I woke up though, to when I would learn would be 2 hours later, around 11, I had to take the dog for a walk. I fell asleep technically today, because I couldn't sleep until 1 am! I ate a breakfast of chia seed pudding with blackberries before I set off to take the dog on a walk. Near the start of my walk, a man nodded at me, and I nodded back, thinking it was a greeting, but as I walked more, when Rufus stopped, I turned around and saw him from the path below staring up at me and writing something in his phone. I got spooked for the rest of the walk, and I was constantly looking back to see if he was still there, but luckily, we were going opposite directions, and I never saw him again. When I came back, I watched Real Madrid get absolutely dominated by PSG, with them losing 4-0 with 2 goals scored in the first 10 minutes, with the third goal being scored within the first 25 while I ate lunch of a burger, that was leftovers from dinner. Later, I read my book a bit more, and ended up playing some more minecraft. <br>
    While I played minecraft, I ended up accomplishing many things, such as transporting villagers to my base for further builds, like an iron farm and trading hall, which all require the help of villagers, creating a three story farm, with wheat, potatoes, and carrots on their own separate layer. I excavated a lot of land, and traded a bunch with my villagers to gather many emeralds, which will be useful once I have all my villagers in the trading hall, but my plan is to create an iron farm first, so that I would have a constant and steady flow of materials into my base. For the iron farm, the way it works is that I would have at least 3 villagers, because that's the minumum number needed to spawn an iron golem, a big iron giant that protects them, that drops iron upon death. If I bring a zombie near them, they will become frightened and will spawn iron golems at a faster rate. With this all sorted out, the iron golems would spawn in a chamber, in which I would have some lava, so that the golem dies, and drops its iron into a collection system for infinite iron. This will be very useful for further projects! After accomplishing the triple layer farm, I decided to stop playing for the day, and that's when my dad came home from work. We both talked for a bit, and I told him about what I did today, and we decided to go to the pool. Once my mom and sister were home, we ate dinner and went to the pool. We completed the lifeguard training challenge, of swimming 150 yards, treading water for 2 minutes, and then swimming another 25 yards without a break. It was honestly pretty easy, but once I was out, I was very tired. Once we got home, we decided to watch the finale of the show "Panchayat" season 4 to end the day.</h3>

    <br>
    <h3>The day started like any other, except unlike yesterday, I actually had something I was going to do. I woke up around 10:30 and went down for a breakfast of toast and overnight oats, while I found a book to read for the day. My dad recommended a book called "Walden," but I couldn't really pay attention to it, because I couldn't make it past the prologue. I ended up finding a book that I had read a long time ago, called "Keeper of the Lost Cities," and I made pretty good progress in the book. It's about this one girl who can read minds and she meets this guy who can also read minds, and she discovers she isn't a human, but an elf. Yeah, it's that kind of story, kind of like those Percy Jackson books, but worse in my opinion. For the next 3-4 hours, I read that book, while occasionally stopping to watch this minecraft youtuber survival series, which I was getting invested in, and it made me really want to play survival minecraft. Around 3, I finally gave in and decided to play some survival minecraft for the first time in a long while. <br>
    When I loaded into the world, I was amazed from all the new features that they had added in the game since I had stopped playing. Now, there were fallen trees, leaves actually fell from the trees, and the caves were a lot better. I was excited to start playing, and I started creating the necessitates, like an axe, pickaxe, shovel, and hoe. I started off by gathering livestock into 3 distinct pens, with chickens, sheep, and cows, so I could start getting a good food source. To make more animals, I started farming wheat so I could feed it to the animals, and they would create babies, so I would have more animals to eat. Once these pens were full, I used some fire to cook about half of the animals in the pen, so I would actually be able to eat all the animals, like cooked chicken, mutton, and steak. While doing this, I was also building my wheat farm, so that it would produce more wheat for my livestock, I repeated this process for about 30 minutes, until I had a good amount of food, when I started to go into the mines to get ores like iron and diamonds. I quickly found iron, and as I went deeper, was lucky enough to find diamonds as well! After a successful mining trip, I went back my base, to the chicken pen and sheep pen exploded! A creeper must've blown up near a villager, and exploded my pen! Nearly all my animals disappeared, but I was able to bring them back, and repair the damages. The day ended when I brought villagers from a neighboring village to my base so that I would be able to created a trading hall. That was a project for another day though, and when I was done playing, it was around 4:30. <br>
    I read my book, and got really close to finishing it, and then me and my dad played with the dog while waiting for my mom to come home, around 6. When she came home, me and her started to make some turkey burgers for dinner, while my dad made some fries and sweet potato fries. They were amazing, with the perfect salt, and the burgers were delicious as well. At the end, I ate about 2 burgers, and was extremely full, and went to lay down in my room, when my parents informed me that they were going on a walk with the dog. I layed in bed and listened to an audiobook while I passed the time until they would be back. Once they got back, I replaced the sheets on my bed, talked a bit to my grandma on my dad's side on the phone, and then got ready to go to sleep, before finally getting in bed with my new sheets, and going to sleep.</h3>

    <h3>Today was a very lazy day, and when I woke up around 10, I was still pretty tired, even though I had slept about 11 hours. My solution to this problem? Stay in bed till 11! When I came downstairs I was starving, and luckily, so were my mom and sister. However, they both had something small, like avocado toast, and I was left with the question; what should I eat for brunch? The answer to that question came from my mom, when she offered to make me an omelette. I was very happy, and accepted her offer, and we started making the omelete together. My job was to cut onions, while she cut the mushrooms, and got the pan ready for cooking. Once I finished cutting the onion, we both put all the vegetables in the pan, and added 3 eggs, while we waited for it to cook. I asked her if she was going to eat anything, and she said, "No, I already ate." Once the eggs were finished, I put them all on my plate. They looked like a mountain on my plate, but I was starving. Soon enough, all the eggs were gone, and I was super full. For the next few hours, nothing really eventful happened, I was just lazing around, and watching something, or eating a snack.<br> 
      Around 4, I felt like I wanted to do something, but didn't know what. I asked my mom, and she told me to finish fixing my bike. This was a grueling task that I really didn't want to get into, but nevertheless, I tried to fix it. She came outside with me, but after about 3 minutes, we both decided to go back inside, as it was hot, and we both didn't want to be there. After this, I decided to read an ebook while trying to take a nap, but got woken up when my mom wanted me to taste test some pasta sauce that my sister made, because she didn't want to get up from the couch, like myself. I begrudgingly got up from the couch, and ended up eating dinner of ravioli soon after. Since my sister made the ravioli, the task fell on me to clean the dishes and put everything on the table away, but as I was almost done, my mom took over the job so I could go take the dog for a walk. When I came back, I was pretty tired, so I wanted to just go to bed early, but I had to make a plan about the upcoming school year with my mom. After this, I went to bed. Tomorrow I've decided that I'm not going to be as lazy, and hopefully will do something more.</h3>
